      <h1> Petunia </h1>
      <p id="Information">Hi, my name is Petunia! <br> I live in the city of Tree Fields, <br> and I live in the most beautiful field!</p>
      <p id="Information">Since I was a young creature, I have faced struggles with my short arms, <br> but that hasn't stopped me from living the life of my dreams!</p>
      <p id="Information">I use my legs to grab objects, and sometimes even my spiky ears! <br> They are great at grabbing apples off trees.</p>
      <p id="Information">Some of my hobbies include <br> reading, eating food, dancing to music, and lounging outside.</p>
      <p id="Information">The weather in Tree Fields is always sunny and warm, <br> which is my favorite. <br> I love working on my tan!</p>
      <p id="Information">If I were to describe myself in 3 words, <br> I would say I am optimistic, friendly, and kind.</p>
      <p id="Information">I love to meet new people, <br> and can't wait to have more adventures <br> and fun times here in Tree Fields!</p>
      <p id="Information">Hope to see you again soon!</p>
